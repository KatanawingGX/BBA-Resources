## Playstyle

Amber is a highly volatile rushdown character. As such, they thrive in knockdown scenarios and scrambles utilizing their IC specials and high mobility. This character excels the most when applying pressure and using their unique air movement to mix up the opponent.

Amber’s general gameplan is to use their air dash, j\[D\], and 5\[D\] to close the gap quickly while applying pressure to the opponent. Once they are knocked down its time to apply the various mixups the character has including left/right and strike/throw mix. The main idea is to knock the opponent down and use your very potent oki setups to break through your opponents defense.

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Lots of plus frames:** Amber has multiple moves that give her plus frames to enforce more pressure **Large amount of mix options:** Due to amber having an air dash this opens up a lot of mixup potential for left/right mixups in addition to everything else **Very potent strike/throw:** Amber has a great stagger window on their grounded lights and a \+2 5B making these great tools for strike/throw. Like it couldn't get better they also have a midscreen combo throw  | **Glass cannon:** Amber is tied with violet for the lowest health in the game. When they’re low enough on health amber can’t use any enhanced special and essentially becomes the worst character in the game **Sub par defensive options:** This character has no real access to defensive options outside the system or that don't deal damage to themselves. **Low damage:** This character has many way to open up their opponent but the reward is mainly the knockdown. The damage output of this character is much lower on average to most characters  |
