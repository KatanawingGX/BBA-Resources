## Playstyle

Penny is a very well rounded character who specializes in heavy space control. She utilizes fast and long range moves and her high movement speed to maneuver around the opponent to whiff-punish them.

This character is best used when capitalizing on an opponent's mistakes from a distance and controlling space with moves like 5D and 2D. As well as advancing forward with moves like 5C and jC to close the distance and also apply up close pressure.

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Rapid fire lights:** Penny’s A moves all can be mashed to have rapid fire lights. These moves can also be slightly staggered to create mixups in your offensive timing **Very dominant screen control:** having not only the fastest walk speed and long range moves this character controls screen space with the best of them  **Combo throw midscreen:** being able to combo mid screen from her throw makes her strike/throw much scarier  | **Weakest offense:** Penny’s general offensive gameplan comes down to game specific things and nothing that the character herself makes any scarier. Mainly consisting of basic strike/throw and instant overhead **Large buttons \= large commitment:** buttons like 5D and 2D which you want to use as a large part of your gameplan are very punishable if blocked. |

## Notable buttons

* **jA:** This move is a very good air to air and jump in for the character.  
* **5C and jC:** This gives Penny her projectile invulnerability and are typically safe of block and generally good approach tools  
* **5D and 2D:** These moves are the core of Penny’s gameplan. Both being very fast and covering large amounts of space allowing her to control the game
