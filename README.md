This is the hub for all Blueblood Arena strategy and information.

# Getting Started

Blueblood Arena is a new fighting game developed by Starcutter. (the developer of Among Us Arena) This game will be available on PC exclusively. (This will also include handheld pc devices such as the Steam Deck and ROG Ally.)

# New to the game

BBA is a 2D fighting game built with a simple input system, along with a varied cast of characters that allow many different styles of play.

Like most other arcade fighting games, BBA is controlled with an 8 direction digital joystick and 4 buttons **A** (light), **B** (heavy), **C** (alpha), and **D** (beta)

Numpad notation is used for movement directions.

**“What is alpha and beta?”**\- These are the game's special move buttons.

## Movement

* Walking  
  * 6 or 4  
    * Walking forward or backward is to just hold either the direction your character is facing (forward) or the opposite (backward)  
    * You can cancel your walking animation with anything including blocking  
* Forward Dash  
  * 66 or 6+dash macro  
    * Dashes move the character forward with a burst of movement.  
    * This does leave you vulnerable while in this animation.  
* Backdash  
  * 44 or 4+dash macro  
    * This movement is invulnerable to throws completely. Backdash is strike invulnerable for differing frames (character dependent)  
* Jump  
  * 7 or 8 or 9  
    * Makes the character jump in the air pressing 7 or 9 will have them jump backward and forward respectively  
* Short hop  
  * Briefly tap 7 or 8 or 9  
    * Using the same input as jump but briefly tapping it will give you a jump height much shorter  
* Crouch  
  * 1 or 2 or 3  
    * Place your character into a crouching animation. Whilst crouching your profile is smaller and you have access to *crouching block* and *crouching attacks*.

## Attacks

* Normals  
  * Light  
    * j.A, 5A, 2A  
  * Heavy  
    * j.B, 5B, 2B  
* Specials  
  * Alpha  
    * j.C, 5C, 2C  
  * Beta  
    * j.D, 5D, 2D  
* Grab  
  * Press A+B (or grab macro) to grab  
    * Grab has 8 frame startup with a 12 frame tech/ throw break window  
* Metered Reversal  
  * Press 2C+D  
    * Fully invulnerable reversal  
    * Very unsafe on block  
* Super  
  * Press C+D (or super macro) to do super  
    * Uses 100 super meter

## Burst

* Press any normal \+ any special to burst (or burst macro)  
  * Blue (defensive burst)  
    * Use this burst to escape combos or during your block stun  
  * Gold (neutral burst)  
    * Can be used only in a neutral scenario (cant use in combo or on defense)  
    * If this burst hits you get a full super meter  
  * Red (offensive/combo)  
    * This burst can be used in a combo to do an extension  
    * This reduces juggle decay fully and lowers damage decay

## Parry

* Press 2A+B  
  * Can parry moves, then attack after the initial parry frames

# Combo System

This game's combo system is relatively straight forward operating heavily on the “i think it works so it does” mindset. This game has a very freeform combo system, some standard things to look for are a character’s launcher (typically 2B) and wall/ground bounce. Some characters even have moves that hit OTG. Blueblood also has its own form of a gatling system for said combos. Things such as 5A \>5B \>5D and 5A \>5B \>5C work. Some specials can even be cancelled into each other.

## Juggle Decay

Juggle decay or in other words “combo scaling” is the biggest limit for your combos. This game has a hidden list containing 15 slots for moves to be stale. This is intended to incentivize players to use all of their moves, because if one move pops up too often it will raise the scaling much higher. This list of moves will reset every time a combo ends.

This game also has an IPS (Infinite Protection System). This is executed by having the opponent character drop much faster during combos when the juggle decay bar is full or past full. When that fills up it will also give your opponent more burst meter if it wasn’t full already. One large part of this system is that if you do more than 10 hit combo while never leaving the ground the juggle decay will increase exponentially. Also, when a combo ends in a knockdown the juggle decay meter does not automatically go to 0\. It will drop gradually as the character's getup animation occurs.

# Strategy

Blueblood Arena’s offensive and defensive options can be simplified down to a rock paper scissor system: Attacking, Blocking/Guarding, and Throwing. Attacking is beaten by blocking, blocking is beaten by throwing, and throwing is beaten by attacking or jumping. Beating throws are a bit more complicated. This rock-paper-scissor triangle is a staple in many fighting games and understanding how it works is important when predicting what your opponent will do and countering it with the option that trumps it.

## Offense/Pressure

Pressure is often described as taking your turn attacking and trying to open your opponent's defenses, but Pressure is a simple term for a complex subject. It's a multi-facetted macro-game within every match.  
Lots of what this game is based on offensively is strike/throw mixups. Lots of value can come from throws due to the fact that every character can combo their super afterwards. Even some characters can just do regular combos from them. Making throws a very valuable offensive option within this game’s system.

### Blockstrings

Blockstrings are a series of attacks performed on someone blocking. You can use blockstrings to enhance your pressure, ideally blockstrings have a few aspects:

* a blockstring that will frame trap the opponent  
* a blockstring should never always end in the same move. Ending on the same move all the time will reduce the threat of making your opponent block if what you do is very obvious  
* blockstrings should sometimes end in moves that are safe. When you run out of moves to use, being safe and returning to neutral is a good option if your offense has to stop.

### Okizeme (Oki)

When an opponent is knocked down the player with advantage in this situation is referred to as “having oki”. You have advantage in this state because your opponent cannot do anything. During oki the advantaged player can:

* Meaty \- this is when the advantaged player performs any attack that's timed so that the active frames overlap with the get-up animation. (this would also include throws)  
* Block/Guard (mainly used to bait reversals of some kind)  
* Instant overhead (typically executed with short hop j.A)

## Defense

Enacting defense is the active prevention of your opponent dealing damage to you. This can include using reads or reactions to block and using fast attacks or reversals to disrupt their offense.

### Blocking/Guarding

Normal blocking will prevent the *Defender* from getting damaged, with exception to chip damage. When the *Defender* has successfully blocked an attack a blue force-field looking barrier visual appears in front of the *Defender*.

Blocking/Guarding can also be performed in the air after a characters pre-jump frames

### Fuzzy Guarding

Essentially fuzzy guarding is trying to block two directions at once, typically high/low. Making the mixup process for your opponent much harder. Especially with a game with very potent instant overheads, fuzzy guarding is a must in your rotation of defensive options.

### Reversals

Reversals in fighting games are a term used to signify a move with some time of invincibility to give the player an opportunity to “reverse” the current offensive situation. These are often very unsafe to use and very punishable if blocked. This games reversals will include:

* Blue and Gold burst  
  * Blue burst can be used from blockstun  
* 2C+D (or level 1\)  
* 2A+B (or parry)

### Throw Option Selects/Throw OS

An option select is defined as the following: “a situation where performing the same inputs can lead to several different outcomes depending on how the characters interact.” These options are used to cover different options including throw depending on the context

* Parry throw OS  
  * 1A+B  
    * If the opponent attempts to throw you, you will tech the throw. If the opponent does nothing or tries to attack you, your character will perform the universal parry.  
* Hit Throw OS  
  * 1A \> throw macro (to do this successfully you must piano this input)  
    * If the opponent attempts to throw you, you will tech the throw.  If the opponent does nothing or tries to attack you, your character's 2A (or whatever attack you inputted) will come out if you aren't in blockstun. Otherwise, you will just block. This option select is used to beat opponents who are trying to run in to throw, or are trying to delay their throw attempt.  
* Anti-air OS  
  * (insert anti air here) \> throw macro (to do this successfully you must piano this input)  
    * If the opponent attempts to throw you, you will tech the throw. If they jump then they will be anti-air.The input required for an AA OS depends on the character, as some characters have a unique anti-air move to use.
