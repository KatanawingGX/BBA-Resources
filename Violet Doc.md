## Playstyle

Violet is Blueblood’s resident setplay zoner using her large buttons and projectiles to always control the pace of the game. She mainly excels in a slightly further than mid screen range for most effective use of her zoning tools.

Violet's general gameplan is keeping the opponent away and using her setplay orb and other projectiles to make an unappealing wall to attack and applying mixups with her grounded overhead to enforce more pressure.

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Zoning strong:**  violets grounded normals and her projectiles make for a very strong zoning game keeping the opponent in violets ideal range at all times **Incredibly potent 50/50 high/low:** whether its on oki or in a block string this character forces unreactable high/lows to defend **Full invulnerable backdash:** this game contains invulnerable backdash but violets is fully invulnerable through its duration (this is an oversight as of 2/12/26) | **Low health:** one of the few weaknesses of the character is just low health. Taking any amount of damage is much more impactful **Slow buttons:** having a slower then average 5A  at 5 frames, and all her other normals are 18 frames of startup making for more committal neutral decisions, and having a weaker punish game when compared to the rest of the cast **No anti airs:** Will have to rely on options like preemptive rising jB to call out opponents’ jumps, which carries a high level of risk. |

## Notable buttons

* **5A:** It's not only fast, but fully disjointed. One of if not your best neutral tool  
* **5B:** This button is so good for controlling space, it also wall bounces and is a great combo ender for oki  
* **2B:** Very unreactable overhead at 18 frames the combos and can be used to force fuzzy blocking.  
* **5C:** This is the character defining move for violet. A very oppressive setplay orb that tracks the opponent. She can manually activate by pressing any A moves or detonating by hitting 5C again.  
* **2D:** A multi-hitting projectile used as combo filler and a strong oki tool, being \+17 and able to be canceled into from 5C letting it hit meaty after ending a combo with 5B. Can also be used to reset pressure, but is risky due to lengthy startup.

* This combo uses an alternative to launch the opponent rather than just the wall bounce from 5B
