## Playstyle

Dimitri is Blueblood’s big body grappler. His main objective is to use his 5D command grab to enforce close range mixups. As a big body he’s also very slow walking which can partly be mitigated by his armored command run 5C or his elbow drop 2C that's forward advancing and projectile invulnerable.

Dimitri is the king of destroying the opponents defensive options by utilizing his 2A to cover options like jump and backdash which will condition them to play your strike throw game. He also has a very good up close defensive game by having multiple moves that alleviate throws and his 2C avoiding projectile oki or general pressure.

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Very high damage:** Befitting of a big body grappler, dimitri has a very high damage ceiling. **Highest health:** Big body with an even bigger health bar. This allows Dimitri to live longer even when taking heavy damage **Very strong defence against throws:** Dimitri has multiple moves that are invulnerable to throws.  **Covers most defensive options with ease:** His large moves like 2A are very good to catch backdash and command grab for parry  | **Slowest walk speed:**  One of the general big body weaknesses just having very slow movement making it harder for him to approach **Weak anti airs:** currently dimitris anti airs are subpar whether the hitboxes are too small or its too slow to actually work  **Highly committal neutral:** Dimitri really needs 2C and 5C currently to exist in the neutral space making his options not only limited but predictable |

## Notable Buttons

* **5A:** Not only is this his fastest button but its also \+4 ON BLOCK this move creates very scary pressure for your opponent especially while they are in the corner  
* **2A:** This button can act as a sweep but also is a great option to cover defensive options that aren't just blocking and allows Dimitri to do an otg follow up to convert. Also \+2 on block  
* **2C:** This is by far dimitris best button. One of the few overheads in the game that start from the ground. Also plus on block. Its forward advancing and projectile invulnerable. This move is a great way to catch backdash and acts as a low crush as well  
* **5D:** This is Dimitri’s command grab, the base of how he will enforce his mixups. Although it is relatively slow at 18 frame startup, it has decent qualities to compensate. 1st it does a very large amount of damage, it's invulnerable to throws which makes this another option to do instead of teching the throw, and its forward advancing to catch people walking back.
