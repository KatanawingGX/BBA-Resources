## Playstyle

Enza is a well-rounded character with tools for just about every situation. As such, she performs well most anywhere, whether it be defense or offense, rushdown or zoning. That said, she excels most at close range where her offense is at its strongest.

Enza’s general gameplan is to get in and keep the pressure to either bait the opponent into making a mistake and then doing a setup using her 2D to enforce strike/throw mix. The main idea is to establish pressure and once the opponent starts to respect it, you start to throw them and force them to guess.

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Strong defense**: Enza’s 2C really allows her to escape some very scary situations with the upper body invulnerability it offers as well as a strong backdash. **Oppressive oki**: Enza’s combos into 2D not only make a scary strike/throw scenario, it gives a potential damage boost if you open up your opponent or get another mixup. **Anti-airs**: Enza has 2 very good anti-airs. Both 2B and 2C have upper body invulnerability and allow for full conversion into 2D setup. Where 2C is much faster 2B has a larger hitbox and covers a larger area. | **Stubby lights:** Enza’s grounded lights are very short ranged in comparison to the other characters in the cast. **Very linear blockstrings:** Most of Enza's blockstrings are very short and all of her real pressure requires preemptive decision making. |

## Notable buttons

* **2D:** This move does so much for you that there has to be a list  
  * Makes all normals on block have 2 more frames of block advantage  
  * Lowers the opponents jump height along with their walk and dash speed.  
  * Enhances all C and D moves while standing in the puddle

* **5B:** Amazing button for fishing out counter hits and shimmying. Also very good combo starter, punishes reversals and its safe on block  
* **2A:** fast low used for stagger pressure. Also best meaty option for oki  
* **j.B:** Terrifying jump normal to throw out, can be held to mix up timing and deals more damage and a ground bounce when fully held  
* **j.A:** Very active air normal which can air to air and crossup
